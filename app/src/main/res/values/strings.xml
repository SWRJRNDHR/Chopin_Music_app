    <string name="info">Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin – the most outstanding Polish composer and pianist,
        born in the village of Żelazowa Wola in the district of Sochaczew. The composer and his family held his date of
        birth to be 1 March 1810, yet the certificate of baptism signed in the parish church of Brochów is dated 22 February.
        That discrepancy has still not been entirely resolved, although today it is the date celebrated by Chopin and his
        family that is more often used. Chopin’s first piano teacher, Adalbert Zywny, had already introduced him to the music
        of Bach and the Viennese classics. As a pianist, however, Chopin is considered to have been self-taught:
        he doesn’t seem to have needed to practise very much. His more extended early works were decorative and brilliant,
        in the line of display pieces by touring virtuosos like Hummel. After giving two big concerts in Warsaw at which he
        introduced his two piano concertos, Chopin left for Vienna in November 1830, staying eight months, during which he
        learnt of the Warsaw Uprising. He never saw Poland again. He made his way to Paris, where he soon felt at home,
        since there were many Polish émigrés in the French capital. His music sold well, and from 1833 it was published
        simultaneously in England, France and Germany. Chopin wrote Nocturnes and shorter pieces in dance forms, such as Mazurkas, Waltzes and Polonaises, throughout his career.
        He found his mature style early, with the first set of Études, Op. 10 (1829–32). These are still, with their sequel,
        the Op. 25 set, the cornerstone of modern piano technique, as well as powerfully poetic pieces.
